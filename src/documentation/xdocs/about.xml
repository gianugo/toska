	 <p>
   JFYI, this site is built and maintained using 
   <link href="http://xml.apache.org/cocoon/">Apache Cocoon</link>. Not
   everyone knows that Cocoon can be used even for offline site geneations,
   as in this case.
   </p>
   <p>
   Another software that I used is 
   <link href="http://www.krysalis.org/centipede">Krysalis Centipede</link>,
   which allowed me to have in minutes a Cocoon set upto produce 
   this site with no hassle. 
   Centipede is more than that, though, since it aims to be
   a complete build system with lots of features. Too many features actually:
   I was unable to come up with a Centipede based Toska distribution since
   Centipede alone was summing up to 10MB compressed: not a big deal for
   200K of source code. But it's definitely worth a look.
