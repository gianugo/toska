   There is no site about a GUI without screenshots, so here we are. They
   are really no big deal, since you can find the same two images in the
   quickstart document, but I plan to come up with more (Linux and MacOSX
   screenshots would ve very appreciated).

   <figure src="images/toska-main.png" alt="Toska main screen"/>

   This screenshot shows a filled-up tree, together with the 
   "New SSH Key" panel.
